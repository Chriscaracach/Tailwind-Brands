## What is this??

Tailwind CSS is the most important CSS framework from the last years. The features this framework introduced are guiding the entire frontend community to a new way to create CSS for modern web applications.

But I'm still using Less.

The times has changed, and is time to get updated.

### What I'll do??

I'll create a big grid, on a simple HTML site. There, I'll use Tailwind to create some layouts, based on well known brands and logos.

I'll follow the official documentation provided from Taiwind's team.

Maybe this project will not be enough to understand Taiwind, but it'll give me at least an idea on how it works. Later, I'll create some other projects.
